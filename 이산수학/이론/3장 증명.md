# 증명은 왜 필요하지?

1. 사람들이 받아들이게 하기 위해서? <-> 설득을 위함?
2. 오류가 없는 컴퓨터 프로그램을 만들기 위해서?
3. 논리연산, 논리 게이트 등 가장 효율적인 추상화로 리소스가 많이 들지 않는, 최소화의 수정으로 최대화된 효과를 내기 위한 논리 게이트를 작성하기 위해서?
  - 왜 이런 오류가 없는 논리 게이트를 작성하려는 걸까?
    - 돈을 절약하기 위해서, 수백만 수천만의 리퀘스트, 리스폰스를 담당하기 위해서는 이 수 많은 논리 회로의 문제들을 해결할 수 있어야한다. 가장 최소화된 절약된, 리소스가 효율화된 리소스를 작성해내야 가장 최적의 퍼포먼스를 낼 수 있으므로

# 증명에서 알아야할게 뭘까?

1. 공리 (公理) - Axiom
   - 公 (public, just) + 理 (principle, reason) = "Publicly accepted principles" 
    - 리 came from the Jade, and the veining patterns. The ancient craft mans had to cut the Jade through the vein patterns, the natural pattern. It becomes the law of nature, and so principle.
      - It is interesting how they got inspired their language with nature. 
   - Reflects axioms as **universally** accepted starting points requiring no proof

2. 증명 (證明) - Proof
   - 證 (evidence, testimony) + 明 (bright, clear) = "To illuminate through evidence"
   - Expresses how proofs bring clarity and certainty to mathematical assertions
3. 정리(定理, theorem)
   - 한자로 '정' 자체가 명확하다, 수학적 진리가 확립된, 고정된 이라는 듯을 갖고 있다. 고대 사람이 지붕 아래 있는 모습을 뜻했으나 그 뜻이 시간을 거치며 점점 물리적인 것에서 철학적 도덕적인 것으로 확장되기 시작했다.
     - 하물며 선정이라는 뜻의 단어도 뜻한다고 한다.
   - 공리로부터 증명된 명제를 정리라고 한다. 
   - 공리들을 바탕으로 논리적으로 증명된 결론.
  `How to logically prove the conclusion?, so the theorem?`
    - 보조정리 사용(lemma) : Helper Theorems
    - `what does theoerm's meaning? what was the root of word?`
       - 정리를 증명하기 위한 과정 중에 사용되는 명제
      `예를 들면 무엇이 있을까?`  
        - 피타고라스 정리 : Pythagorean Theorem
        - 페르마의 마지막 정리 : Fermat's Last Theorem
   - 파스칼 삼각형 (帕斯卡三角形) - Pascal's Triangle
      - 三 (three) + 角 (angle, corner) + 形 (shape) = "Three-cornered shape"
      - Descriptive name for the triangular array of numbers
  `Why Pascal's Triangle is an example of Proof in this book?`
  `why I must know about Theorems for understanding this proof chapter?`
   - Theorem seems the foundation of mathematic and problem solving.

1. 수학적 귀납법 (數學的歸納法) - Mathematical Induction
   - 數學 (numbers + study = mathematics)
   - 歸 (to return) + 納 (to include, gather in) + 法 (method) = "Method of returning and gathering"
     - 귀 means, return into some spot. 납 means similar with 수납, gathering into some place.
     - so they mean, put them all into something. gathering a spreaded knowledge, and result into some specific statement.
     - multiple examples into one representative principle.
   - Reflects how induction builds from specific cases back to general principles
   `when should I use it?`
      - when there is a lot of examples?
        - Good for natural numbers?
        - Small to Big model, like Fibonacci
        <!-- seems very good for computer science or algorithmic solution -->
   `but as far as I know there are steps to imply this Mathematical Induction, how can I master it? for that, it seems I need to use the questionaires book to practice my adaptation of this.`

2. 간접 증명법 (間接證明法) - Indirect Proof
   - 間 (between) + 接 (to connect) + 證明法 (proof method) = "Between-connecting proof method"
   - Indicates a proof that reaches truth through intermediary steps rather than directly
   `간접 증명법은 왜 간접증명법인가? Indirective proof? why is that? because they don't put the parameters into the real ones?`
   `Indirect Proof Method is a kind of things that doesn't solve the problem in directly, but a bit indirectly. why is that?`
   1. 대우 증명법 (對偶證明法) - Contrapositive Proof
      - 對 (opposite, to correspond) + 偶 (pair) = "Corresponding pair"
      - Captures how contrapositive proofs work with logical equivalences

   2. 모순 증명법 (矛盾證明法) - Proof by Contradiction
      - 矛 (spear) + 盾 (shield) = "Spear and shield"
      - From ancient Chinese paradox of "a spear that can pierce any shield and a shield that can block any spear"
      - Perfectly embodies logical contradiction
      `by proving the contradiction, negation is 'false' so the statement was right. very exceptional case. but when to use this? when would be great case to use this?`
   3. 반례 증명법 (反例證明法) - Proof by Counterexample
      - 反 (against, contrary) + 例 (example) = "Contrary example"
      - Exactly expresses what a counterexample is
      `finding an exceptional opposite case, so that creates the statement was wrong`
   4. 구성적 존재 증명법 (構成的存在證明法) - Constructive Existence Proof
      - 構成 (to construct, to build) + 存在 (to exist) = "Construction of existence"
      - Describes proofs that demonstrate existence by actually building the object
      - Constructive Existence Proof : Creating a real number to show up the proving process.

   5. 비구성적 존재 증명법 (非構成的存在證明法) - Non-constructive Existence Proof
      - 非 (not, non-) + 構成的存在證明法 (constructive existence proof) = "Not constructing existence"
      - Indicates proofs that show something exists without explicitly constructing it

3. 다양한 증명방법 (多樣한 證明方法) - Various Proof Methods
   - 多 (many) + 樣 (form, pattern) = "Many forms/patterns"
   - Accurately describes the variety of proof approaches

   1. 전수증명법 (全數證明法) - Exhaustive Proof
      - 全 (all, whole) + 數 (number, count) = "All numbers/cases"
      - Reflects proving by checking every possible case

   2. 조합적 증명법 (組合的證明法) - Combinatorial Proof
      - 組 (group) + 合 (combine) = "Grouping and combining"
      - Captures the essence of using counting principles and arrangements in proofs

   3. 컴퓨터를 이용한 증명 (電腦를 利用한 證明) - Computer-Assisted Proof
      - 電 (electricity) + 腦 (brain) = "Electric brain" (computer)
      - 利用 (to use, utilize) = "Utilizing the electric brain"
      - Modern approach leveraging computational power for mathematical proofs

      1. 4색 정리 (四色定理) - Four Color Theorem
         - 四 (four) + 色 (color) + 定理 (established principle) = "Four color established principle"
         - Famous theorem proven with computer assistance

      2. 골드바호의 추측 (哥德巴赫의 推測) - Goldbach's Conjecture
         - 推 (to push, infer) + 測 (to measure, conjecture) = "Pushed measurement/inference"
